# Elevator Coding Challenge

## Goal

Design and implement an elevator control system in Python that handles `k` elevators and `n` floors. The interface should: 

1. Allow a user to query the state of the elevators
2. Allow an elevator to update its state in the system
3. Allow a user to submit a pickup request
4. Include a time-stepping simulation
